# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## libraries

This project use [Tailwind](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs), and also use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

## good practices

- Use arrow function component
- don't abuse of useState
- function should do just one thing
- if a function have more than 5 parameters, use object to encapsulate them
- dont't use var
- functions that use firebase should be in the api folder

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
